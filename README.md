## About This Document

This document was created by a cohort convened by The Light Collective, a national community of patient activists, clinicians, and health data experts committed to building tech and digital rights for patients. The cohort is a diverse task force of patient-oriented experts and community leaders to craft patient-led standards for the design, use, and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Our aim is to define standards and rules in health AI to advance the rights, interests, and concerns of patient communities in health technology. This is a living document. A group of thirteen is not ‘representative’ of all patients. As The Light Collective moves forward, it continues to solicit and incorporate perspectives and voices of a wide range of communities - [see here](#revisions-process-for-this-document) for ways that you can provide your input and feedback into future versions of this document.

## Disclaimer

The collective impact of AI holds the potential to advance research, accelerate cures, and improve care. Simultaneously–as it pertains to patient health–it is one of the most concerning issues of our time. In shaping this document and reflecting on patient rights with respect to artificial intelligence in healthcare, we wrestled with our duty to the individual and the diverse communities of which we are a part.

This document outlines a set of patient rights we believe are critical to the creation and application of AI in healthcare. This patient-led declaration of rights is necessary to establish the patient voice in initiatives that are already forming AI standards, codes of conduct, and Bills of Rights, and that do not include representation from patients. Our aim for this document is to establish a baseline for patient concerns and remedies in Health AI.

We believe that health AI should be guided by the voices and perspectives of patients and diverse racial and ethnic communities. We should have a say in any decisions that affect us. Nothing should be decided about us, without us.

## Patient Rights in Health Care Artificial Intelligence: A Call to Action

In the current landscape, health systems and technology developers are fervently embracing artificial intelligence (AI) tools to assist clinicians in their roles, and facilitate various other processes in the healthcare system. However, amid this haste, there persists a significant oversight—the exclusion of patient perspectives in the design and governance of AI solutions. The omission of patient representation repeats history we do not want to see: a power dynamic where those with the most influence in healthcare at best tokenize and at worst ignore the voices of those they serve. In doing so, they risk creating technologies that not only fail to address some of the most fundamental problems they were designed to affect–improved care and better outcomes for patients–but that exacerbate existing disparities and directly cause additional harm.

Crucial questions emerge that we must consider: How might we ensure equal benefit for all, while upholding patient rights in the process? How might we build AI systems that ensure patient community oversight of the ways in which this emerging technology is harnessed in healthcare? How can we build transparency and truly informed consent into uses of AI in healthcare? How might we build governance systems that center the perspectives, interests, and needs of the communities who are most impacted by AI?

As individuals with extensive lived experiences navigating health challenges, we recognize the potential power of AI and big data to transform healthcare. However, for AI to be truly transformative, it must embody qualities of safety, accuracy, equity, and above all, respect for the individuals upon whom the algorithms are trained and utilized.

The inclusion of patient voices in health policy and decision-making around AI models is not just desirable but a matter of life and death for vulnerable patient populations. By actively involving those who have spent considerable time navigating the complexities of healthcare firsthand, we aim to ensure that AI development aligns with the diverse needs and rights of the individuals it aims to serve. This inclusivity is not just a moral imperative; it is foundational to the responsible and effective deployment of AI in health and in care. These insights are integral to shaping a healthcare AI landscape that is impactful, ethical, and transparent [\[1\]](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2023.15481)[\[2\]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00687-3)[\[3\]](https://doi.org/10.1001/amajethics.2020.395).

<a id="foreword"></a>
## Foreword

Now, more than ever, technology enables seemingly irrelevant sources of behavioral and personal data to be used for the benefits of health or healthcare. However, the use of such data is often hidden or unclear to the generators of the data—and its original owners (i.e., patients)—which can contribute to privacy violations and potential harm, while at the same time blocking patient access to their own personal data.

For example, digital technologies—such as hospital portals, search engines, apps, and online support groups—can be vital, often life-saving tools for people navigating health challenges. However, these technologies may also expose patients to privacy breaches, [illegal data sharing](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites), exploitation of health vulnerabilities, mis- and dis-information[[4]](https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djab141), fraud, and other harms, which we refer to as “cyber harms” [[5]](https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/critical-link-between-health-care-cybersecurity-and-health-disinformation)[[6]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-02167-6). Patients are also likely to be limited in their ability to use health technologies for positive purposes because they are unable to access their own data or are constrained in terms of the portability and accessibility of their data, even between their own personal devices.

In addition, as patient communities use these technologies, we generate new potential for harm or threats to patient safety, while enriching the companies that collect and control these technologies[[7]](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003320609-27/age-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff). To date, there is little transparency or accountability for the variety of [cyber harms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02167-6) that impact patient populations. Patients and patient communities typically do not have any voice in how their information is used and shared in the deployment of health AI.

We therefore advocate for the creation of an independent, patient-led governance body for health technology. This body will define digital rights for health AI and collaborate with regulatory authorities and stakeholders to enforce these rights.

In 2019, the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) developed and articulated the [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (PDF)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b363b502ff481fce6baf/1670886246948/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) and a [set of rights around ‘data for governance’ and ‘governance of data’](https://www.gida-global.org/data-rights). We cite these principles as inspiration for the definition of patient rights in health AI, and we advocate for data sovereignty and enforceable legal rights for patient communities.

Below we outline specific rights and protections we seek in the context of digital technologies and personal data in the era of health AI. Further, we outline for each right what it means in plain language, why it matters, and how it might be actualized in practice.

While doctors have to follow strict rules because of their medical licenses and promises like the Hippocratic Oath, companies that make AI are not guided by these same rules.<br><br>
If AI replaces the duties of doctors, we need to make sure that AI also has a strong duty to independently serve patients' interests.<br><br>
Tech companies usually aim to make as much money as possible for their shareholders, which might not always be good for patient outcomes. Therefore, when AI plays a role in healthcare, patients require independent representation with a duty to ensure patients are treated fairly and well, without any other conflicts getting in the way.

      Self-determination is important because AI is increasingly used to determine a patient’s access to care or a specific treatment.<br><br>

AI Predictions about health risk are no replacement for informed decision-making.  For example, if AI is making predictions about a patient’s health risk and those predictions are  inaccurate, then a patient may lose benefits, choices, or access to care.<br><br>

Patients must reserve the right to defy odds, even if odds are not in their own favor.  Patients must have autonomy when it comes to separation of their private lives from decisions about care.  
    </td>

    Patients should be given the chance to make an informed decision to opt out or appeal AI generated decisions. <br><br>

If a predictive algorithm is used to determine a patient’s access to a certain treatment, there should be a right to appeal the decision.<br><br>

For example, AI should not be leveraged to deny care, limit choices, or ration care that is otherwise considered <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8667701/">standard of care</a>.<br><br>

For example, social media posts or online purchases should not be sourced to create “risks scores” about patient behavior or health that are used in clinical practice.

## Appendix

<a id="definitions-terminology"></a>
### Definitions/Terminology

- **Algorithm:** A computer-generated set of instructions created by looking at a patient or community’s health data and finding patterns. Algorithms in health can use data to predict a person’s risk of a certain health outcome.
- **Algorithmic Transparency:** The principle that the mechanisms of decision-making algorithms, especially in AI, should be open and understandable to users and other stakeholders. If the algorithm is a “black box” or protected for intellectual property reasons, the mechanisms by which they generally work and/or the outputs should be transparent, understandable, and auditable to/by the user.
- **Anonymization:** The process of removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous and unidentifiable.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Technology that can do any of the following: learning from data, making decisions, solving problems, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and adapting to new information. AI refers to the development and application of algorithms and software to process complex medical data, assist in diagnosis, personalize treatment plans, and enhance healthcare delivery overall.
- **Bad Actors:** We define bad actors in this document as those who knowingly work against the interest of a patient or patient community. Bad actors could be cyber criminals, scammers, or companies wishing to leverage or monetize patient data in ways that cause harm to an individual or community.
- **Conflict of Interest:** A conflict of interest happens when a person or organization’s own interests might interfere with their ability to do their job or make fair decisions on behalf of a patient.
- **Cybersecurity:** The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, theft, or harm to a person or property.
- **Data Collective:** A group arrangement where data from many individuals is aggregated into a shared collective pool.
- **Data Portability:** The principle that individuals have the right to receive, transfer, and use their personal data across different services.
- **Designated Record Set (DRS):** Under HIPAA, a Designated Record Set refers to all of the health and billing records a healthcare provider or plan uses to make decisions about an individual patient’s care. HIPAA ensures that patients have the right to access and review these records to verify their accuracy.
- **Discrimination:** Limiting choices, access to care, or outcomes of different people based on their medical conditions, disabilities, race, ethnicity, gender choice, age, language, socio-economic and legal status.
- **Fiduciary:** A fiduciary is someone legally required to act in the best interests of another person, putting those interests above their own. For example, in an attorney-client relationship, the attorney has a fiduciary duty to represent the client's interests faithfully and confidentially, ensuring their legal rights are protected.
- **Health AI:** A branch of artificial intelligence technology that focuses on the creation of systems capable of processing health-related data, making decisions, and performing actions with minimal human intervention. It's used in various healthcare applications, from diagnostics to treatment recommendations.
- **Health Data Breach:** An incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential health data is accessed or disclosed without authorization.
- **Governance:** The process for making decisions and rules. “Technology Governance” is about making rules and policies that a group of people, like a hospital or a health tech company, must use to make sure health technology is used in a good and safe way.
- **Informed Consent:** The process by which patients are fully informed about the procedures and risks involved in a healthcare intervention or technology. Informed consent requires patients to learn about and understand the benefits or risks to them before they choose to use that technology.
- **Legal Recourse:** The right of an individual to seek or attain legal remedy in court due to a loss or harm, breach of contract, violation of privacy, or misuse of data.
- **Patient Autonomy:** The right of patients to make informed decisions about their own healthcare, free from coercion or interference from others.
- **Patient-Governed Data Trusts:** Entities established to manage patient data, where the control and decision-making authority lies with the patients themselves. These trusts have a duty of loyalty to prioritize patient interests in the use of their health data.
- **Predictive Profiling:** The use of data analysis tools to predict individuals' future behavior or health outcomes based on their personal data, whether it is health-specific data or other types of data.
- **Traceability:** The ability to know the source and handling of data that is used in health AI.[[15]](https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc5020020)

### Case Examples/Vignette Collection:

- **False Risk:** Amelia is a newly diagnosed stage 4 cancer patient. She had a recurrence after an early stage diagnosis. Looking for help, she finds an app that she feels might be able to help her. This app uses AI to match patients to clinical trials. Amelia downloads the app, and puts in her medical history. She finds that the app does not have information on her specific subtype. With later involvement with this app, the AI output from this app shares information on clinical trials for brain mets. Amelia does not have brain mets. Amelia wonders if she does in fact have brain mets, and questions if her oncologist has not told her everything.

- **Early Detection:** Steven is an avid runner, watches what he eats, and is in overall good health. For a period of two days, he is not feeling well, and assumes he has the flu. He goes to see his primary care physician. The PCP’s office has started using AI to track patients' wellness and potential symptoms. The report back gave a warning about a possible AKI (Acute Kidney Injury). Steven was able to get the help he needed before, his condition became worse. AI can now predict an AKI up to 2 days before the injury occurs, whereas these types of injuries are often not diagnosed until after they have happened.

- **Automated Denials:** Jack needs a specific medication to treat the cancer he has been diagnosed with. The insurance company using AI to automate medication approvals, denies the coverage. Jack’s oncologist, with the help of AI, submits an appeal on the medical necessity of this medication for the diagnosis. The insurance company responds with another denial (using AI as its only source of information). This back and forth continues for weeks, until finally, a judge (human) needs to make the final decision on whether Jack should receive his treatment. The insurance company solely relied on AI-powered decision-making without human intervention to make its “informed” decision.

- **Targeting A Community:** Maria organizes a community on social media, with the goal of helping her community find support, resources, and access to research. Unbeknownst to Maria and the participants, a health startup begins to develop a list of members. Another startup scrapes the posts of the group to train to predict suicidal behavior among people with her condition without consent, and the predictive model starts getting used in clinical care. A pharma marketing firm acquires the members’ posts and uses the data to create predictive profiles of the members to better target them with advertisements. A malicious actor acquires the list of Maria’s community, and uses the information to target vaccine misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic.

- **Early Discharge:** Carol is a rare disease patient with multiple comorbidities. After being admitted to the hospital with an injury, her care team used an AI model to determine her treatment options based on her risk of developing sepsis. Because these algorithms are based on others without her additional comorbidities, the algorithm did not represent her risk accurately. Carol is recommended for early discharge from her hospital stay, and she develops sepsis within 24 hours, despite what the risk model predicted for Carol. After further investigation and independent validation of the algorithm, it turns out that many patients were discharged early due to a highly inaccurate, newly deployed AI model.
